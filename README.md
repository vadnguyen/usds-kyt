# IRS Labs Template

This template serves basic HTML, JavaScript and CSS file prototypes from the 'public' directory using Node JS.

To use this template, drop all files that you would like to be served into the 'public' directory (aka folder). You can then upload the entire directory using git or the 'Zip Upload' feature on IRS Labs to upload the entire prototype an IRS Labs project.

If your prototype has an index.html file, it will be automatically available after logging in to your prototype.
